# Lab 4: Advanced JavaScript and Web Forms

This lab focuses on advanced JavaScript concepts, form handling, and client-side authentication.

## Contents

- `task1.html`, `task1.css`, `task1.js`: Advanced DOM manipulation and event handling
- `task2.html`, `task2.css`, `task2.js`: Working with JavaScript objects and arrays
- `task3login.html`, `task3login.js`, `task3signup.html`, `task3signup.js`: Client-side authentication system
- `task4.html`, `task4.css`, `task4.js`: Form validation and data processing

## Topics Covered

- Advanced JavaScript concepts
- JavaScript objects and arrays
- Client-side form validation
- Basic authentication flow (signup and login)
- Event delegation and bubbling
- DOM traversal techniques
- Local storage for data persistence

## Setup Instructions

No special setup required for this lab. The web pages can be viewed directly in any modern web browser.

### How to Run

1. Open any HTML file (e.g., `task1.html`, `task2.html`, etc.) in a web browser by either:

   - Double-clicking the file in a file explorer
   - Dragging the file into an open browser window
   - Right-clicking and selecting "Open with" your preferred browser

2. For the authentication system, start with the signup page (`task3signup.html`) to create an account, then proceed to the login page (`task3login.html`).

3. To view the source code:
   - Right-click on the webpage and select "View Page Source" or use Ctrl+U in most browsers
   - Or open the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in any text editor or IDE

## Learning Objectives

- Implement advanced DOM manipulation techniques
- Work with JavaScript objects and arrays effectively
- Create a basic client-side authentication system
- Apply comprehensive form validation
- Understand event propagation in the DOM
- Use local storage for client-side data persistence
