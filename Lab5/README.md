# Lab 5: JavaScript Event Handling and Dynamic Content

This lab explores JavaScript event handling, image manipulation, and creating dynamic web content.

## Contents

- `Task1.html`, `Task1.js`: Basic event handling and callbacks
- `Task2.html`, `task2.js`: Image gallery with dynamic content (using `task2pic1.jpg`, `task2pic2.jpg`, `task2pic3.jpg`)
- `task3.html`, `task3.js`: Advanced event listeners and propagation
- `task4.html`, `task4.css`, `task4.js`: DOM manipulation and dynamic styling
- `task5.html`, `task5.js`: Form handling and validation
- `task6.html`, `task6.js`: AJAX basics and data fetching

Additional image assets:

- `city.jpg`, `nature.jpg`, `ocean.jpg`: Images used in various tasks

## Topics Covered

- JavaScript event handling (click, hover, submit, etc.)
- Event propagation (bubbling and capturing)
- Dynamic image galleries
- DOM traversal and manipulation
- Form validation techniques
- Dynamic styling with JavaScript
- Introduction to AJAX concepts

## Setup Instructions

No special setup required for this lab. The web pages can be viewed directly in any modern web browser.

### How to Run

1. Open any HTML file (e.g., `Task1.html`, `task2.html`, etc.) in a web browser by either:
